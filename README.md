# SUMU
This repo hosts the code for paper **"Towards Sequence Utility Maximization under Utility Occupancy Measure"** which was submitted to the ACM TKDD Journal..

## Requirements
Java programming language.

## Running the program
A simple way is to run the java test file.

## Benchmarks
- The data format used is the same as in the file husp_BIBLE.txt

## Introduction
This paper first defines utility occupancy on sequence data and raises the problem of High Utility Occupancy Sequential Pattern Mining (HUOSPM). Three dimensions, including frequency, utility, and occupancy, are comprehensively evaluated in HUOSPM. An algorithm called Sequence Utility Maximization with Utility occupancy measure (SUMU) is proposed. Furthermore, two data structures for storing related information about a pattern, Utility-Occupancy-List-Chain (UOL-Chain) and Utility-Occupancy-Table (UO-Table) with six associated upper bounds, are designed to improve efficiency.
